  <li style="color: red">The deadlines are final! <b>Please note that we are obeying the faculty
    subgroups!</b><br/>
    Even if you are attending a laboratory with another subgroup the deadlines are the one associated with your
    faculty subgroup.<br/>
    Please check the subgroup allocation with your laboratory instructor.
  </li>
  <li>
    <div style="color: red">In order to meet the deadlines, you need to ensure that the last commit, for the
      work, was done on the day before the laboratory day!
    </div>
    Eg. If your laboratory is on Tuesday, November 8th, then the commit date should be
    before November 8th 00:00 hours (GMT+2).
  </li>
  <li>
    <div style="color: red">We will apply a 25% penalty per week (Attention: calendar week not school week).</div>
    Eg. If the laboratory due date is on Monday, October 23rd, the last commit for a 100% grade should be done till October 22nd, 00:00 hours (GMT+2) - the day before the laboratory day!<br/>
    If the commit date is greater than October 23rd, 00:00, the applied penalty will be 25%.<br/>
    If the commit date is greater than October 30st, 00:00, the applied penalty will be 50%.<br/>
    If the commit date is greater than November 6th, 00:00, the applied penalty will be 75%.<br/>
    After November 13, 00:00 hours (GMT+2), the applied penalty will be 100%.

    It is mandatory to upload the sources on GitHub, but it is not sufficient to receive a grade!</br>

    The application should offer CRUD operations on business objects. The main screen should be a list of the
    business objects and it should allow at least the following operations:
    <ul>
      <li>Create - create new elements that will be added to the list.</li>
      <li>Read - present the elements in a list.</li>
      <li>Update - allow the user to update an element found in the list.</li>
      <li>Delete - delete existing elements from the list.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>The application should <b>persist</b> the content locally, to be able to allow <b>offline</b> access. And while
    online it should <b>synchronize</b> the content with a remote <b>server</b> (implemented also by you, in the
    language of your choice, <b>NO</b> server-less solutions are allowed).
    The communication with the server should be managed using <b>REST</b> services, and it should have counterpart
    operations for <b>each</b> of the operations mentioned above.
    While offline the application will perform the following actions:
    <ul>
      <li>On update and delete - a message will be displayed, that the application is offline and the operation is
        not available.
      </li>
      <li>On read - the content from the local database will be displayed, with a note that the server connection is
        down.
      </li>
      <li>On create - the input will be persisted in the local database and when the application will detect that
        the device is able to connect again to the server will push only the created entries, while the device was
        offline.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="section">Final grade</div>
    <ul>
      <li>For meeting all the deadlines and requirements you will gain 2 points for each.</li>
      <li>LG(Laboratory Grade) = ProjectIdea (2p) + UI-Only-Native (2p) + UI-Only-NonNative (2p) + DB (2p) + Server
        (2p).

      <li>EG(Exam Grade) - the grade from the practical exam.</li>
      <li>FG(Final Grade) = if(LG >= 4.5 && EG >= 5 ) LG * 0.6 + EG * 0.4 else 0</li>
      <li>In order to take the practical exam, you need to have at least 90% of the laboratory presences.</li>
      <li>If LG < 4.5 or the criteria of the presence are not meet then you are allowed to attend <b>only</b> the
        practical exam in
        the re-examination session. In this case, the practical exam will have a different requirement, to cover the
        laboratory-grade too.
