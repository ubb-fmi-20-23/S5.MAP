  <div class="section">Individual Project Details</div>
  <ul>
    <li style="color: red">Due: last laboratory (April 11th, 2023) before Easter break.</li>
    <li>Details:
      <ul>
        <li>An essey of at least 500 words on a topic selected from the 'Essays Titles' file from Teams.</li>
        <li>A simple RESTful web service. A client and server that will implement the CRUD operations.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Expected outcome:
      <ul>
        <li>The source code should be hosted in the individual github classroom repository.</li>
        <li>
          At least the following requirements should be met:
          <ul>
            <li>The server should be able to receive HTTP requests from clients using the RESTful API.</li>
            <li>The server should be able to respond to these requests with the appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g. 200
              OK, 404 Not Found, etc.) and a response body in JSON format.</li>
            <li>The server should have a database or other data storage mechanism to persist data sent by clients.</li>
            <li>The server should implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the data stored in the
              database.</li>
            <li>The server should handle concurrent requests from multiple clients.</li>
            <li>The server should validate incoming requests to ensure that they conform to the expected format and that
              the data being sent is valid.</li>
            <li>The client should be able to send requests to the server to create, read, update, and delete data using
              HTTP methods (e.g. POST, GET, PUT, DELETE).</li>
            <li>The client should be able to receive responses from the server in JSON format.</li>
            <li>The client should display the data received from the server in a user-friendly way.</li>
            <li>The client should provide a way for the user to input data and send requests to the server.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="section">Team Project Details - Team</div>
  <ul>
    <li style="color: red">Due: May 25th, 2023. </li>
    <li>Details:
      <ul>
        <li>A team of two students to tackle a bigger project. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Expected outcome:
      <ul>
        <li>The source code should be hosted in the team github classroom repository.</li>
        <li>
          At least the following requirements should be met:
          <ul>
            <li>The project should use web services technology (e.g. SOAP, REST) to allow clients to access the server's
              functionality.</li>
            <li>The MOM framework used should support load balancing to distribute incoming requests across multiple
              servers to ensure that no single server becomes overloaded.</li>
            <li>The MOM framework used should support failover to ensure that if one server fails, requests can be
              automatically redirected to another available server to ensure continuous service.</li>
            <li>The MOM framework used should provide message persistence to ensure that messages are not lost in the
              event of a server failure.</li>
            <li>The MOM framework used should provide reliable message delivery to ensure that messages are delivered to
              their intended recipients, even in the event of a network failure or other disruption.</li>
            <li>The MOM framework used should support message queuing to enable asynchronous communication between
              clients and servers.</li>
            <li>The project should be designed to scale horizontally to handle increasing numbers of clients and data
              volume.</li>
            <li>The MOM framework used should provide security features to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and
              availability of messages.</li>
            <li>The project should be designed to work with existing MOM frameworks, such as Apache ActiveMQ, IBM MQ, or
              RabbitMQ.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <div class="section">Final grade</div>
  <ul>
    <li style="color: red">You will receive a final grade only if you successfully submitted the details for both the
      individual and the team project.</li>
    <li>Final Grade = IndividualGrade * 0.5 + TeamGrade * 0.5</li>
    <li>If the above deadlines are not met for one of the projects in order to receive a grade you will need to
      attend the session exam. </br>In this case the Final Grade = IndividualGrade * 0.4 + TeamGrade * 0.4 + Exam Grade * 0.2</li>
