          the work and the whole team will receive an grade (TeamProjectGrade).
        </li>
        <li>Using TeamProjectGrade together with the grades from each teamGrades.txt file we will compute a grade
          for each member. Using a formula like: MemberTeamGrade = TeamProjectGrade * avg(teamGrades.txt)/10.

    <li>If Final Grade < 4.5 or the presences criteria are not meet, than in order to receive a grade you will need to
