About the CDI extension
=======================

This module contains the CDI extension and an installer that allows
you to deploy it as shared service to the JBoss Application Server (requires 6.0.0-CR1 or later).

[Creating a CDI project]

Errai ships with a maven archetype that can be used to easily create a
project skeleton that uses GWT, CDI and Errai. Please check the userguide for the
most recent instructions how to do this.
