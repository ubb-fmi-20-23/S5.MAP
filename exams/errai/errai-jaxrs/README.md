# Errai JAX-RS Integration Module

This module simplifies the integration of REST-based services in GWT client applications. Errai JAX-RS can 
generate proxies based on JAX-RS interfaces which will handle all the underlying communication and 
serialization logic. All that's left to do is to invoke a Java method.
