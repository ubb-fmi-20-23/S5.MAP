# Future Live Streams

I try as best I can to announce the next live streams in advance. If it's scheduled you can find the time and topics on the the official [Coding Train website](http://thecodingtrain.com) homepage. All times are in EDT and are subject to change! You can confirm the exact time by visiting [The Coding Train Live](https://www.youtube.com/thecodingtrain/live). I typically schedule the time the morning of.

# Add your own variation

If you want to share your own variation based on a Coding Train video, you can also do this by visiting the page corresponding to the video on our [website](http://thecodingtrain.com). Check out the [Community Contributions Guide](https://github.com/CodingTrain/website/wiki/Community-Contributions-Guide) to see how it's done. It will then be featured right under the video on the website for everyone to see!

# Help adding new videos
