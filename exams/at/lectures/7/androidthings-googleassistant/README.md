# Google Assistant API Sample for Android Things

This codelab shows how to call the Google Assistant API from Android Things using gRPC. It records a spoken request from the connected microphones, sends it to the Google Assistant API and plays back the Assistant's spoken response on the connected speaker.

You can [get started](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/androidthings-assistant/) with the codelab to learn how to set up and run the sample.

Alternatively, you can run [the full sample](https://github.com/androidthings/sample-googleassistant).
